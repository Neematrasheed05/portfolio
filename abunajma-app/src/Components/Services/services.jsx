             At "Abu Najma with Kids Program," our commitment extends beyond the television screen. We proudly offer a comprehensive range of services to enrich the lives of young minds in diverse and meaningful ways. Schools that officially book with us gain access to a tailored educational experience at a nominal fee. On specific days, our team visits these schools, delivering engaging and interactive sessions that go beyond conventional teaching methods. As we carry the esteemed Horizon TV, our program serves as a unique advertising platform, allowing institutions to reach a wide audience.

We actively encourage parents to bring their children, assuring them that we are dedicated to nurturing and guiding every child, regardless of their background or abilities. Join us in this holistic journey of education, mentorship, and joy, where we strive to create a positive impact on the lives of young individuals.
